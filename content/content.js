{"maximumSentences":7,"searchTerm":"Clube de Regatas do Flamengo","prefixe":"The history of","sourceContentOriginal":"Clube de Regatas do Flamengo (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈklubi dʒi ʁeˈɡataʒ du flaˈmẽɡu]; English: Flamengo Rowing Club), commonly referred to as Flamengo, is a Brazilian sports club based in Rio de Janeiro best known for their professional football  team.\nThe club was first established in 1895 as a rowing club and played their first official match in 1912. Flamengo's traditional uniform features red and black striped shirts with white shorts, and red and black striped socks. Flamengo has typically played their home matches in the Maracanã, the national stadium of Brazil, since its completion in 1950, with some exceptions in recent years. Since 1969, the vulture (Portuguese: urubu) has been the most recognized mascot of Flamengo.Flamengo established themselves as one of Brazil's most successful sports clubs in the 20th century during of the era of state leagues in Brazil when they captured several Campeonato Carioca (Rio de Janeiro state league) titles prior to the establishment of the first Brazilian national football league in 1959. Since then, they have remained successful in Brazilian football, having won 7 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, 3 Copa do Brasil, and a record 35 Campeonato Carioca. They are one of three clubs to have never been relegated from the Brasileirão. In South American and worldwide competitions, the club's highest achievements are their conquests of the 1981 and 2019 Copa Libertadores, and 1981  Intercontinental Cup against Liverpool, led by the club's most iconic player Zico. Flamengo's fiercest and longest-standing rivalries are with the other \"Big Four\" of Rio de Janeiro: Fluminense, Botafogo and Vasco da Gama.\nFlamengo is the most popular club in Brazil, with over 30 million supporters as of 2018. As of 2017, it is also Brazil's richest football club with an annual revenue of R$648.0 million (€163.04 million) and a valuation of over R$1.69 billion (€425.21 million).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment of the club (1895–1912) ===\nFlamengo was founded on November 17, 1895, by a group of rowers gathered at club member Nestor de Barros's manor on Flamengo Beach in Rio de Janeiro. In the late 19th century, rowing was the elite sport in the region and the group hoped to impress the young women of the city's high society by establishing a rowing club. Previously, they could only afford a used boat named Pherusa, which had to be completely rebuilt before it could be used in competition. The team debuted on October 6, 1895, when they sailed off the Caju Point toward Flamengo Beach. However, strong winds turned over the boat and the rowers nearly drowned. They were rescued by a fishing boat named Leal (Loyal). Later as the Pherusa was undergoing repairs, it was stolen and never found again. The group saved money to buy a new boat, the Etoile, renamed Scyra.\n\nOn the night of November 17, the group gathered at Nestor de Barros's manor on Flamengo beach and founded the Grupo de Regatas do Flamengo (English: Flamengo Rowing Group) and elected its first board and president (Domingos Marques de Azevedo). The name was changed a few weeks later to its current title of Clube de Regatas do Flamengo (Flamengo Rowing Club). The founders decided that the anniversary of the club's foundation should be commemorated on November 15 to coincide with Republic Procalamation Day, a national holiday.\nFlamengo's football team was only established after a group of ten dissatisfied players from Fluminense broke away from that club following a dispute with its board. The players decided to join Flamengo because Alberto Borgerth, the team's captain, was also a rower for Flamengo. Also, establishing a land sports department at Flamengo was preferable to joining football rivals Botafogo or the all-English club Paissandu. The new members were admitted on November 8, 1911. A motion against the club taking part in football tournaments was defeated, and as a result the members officially established the team on December 24, 1911.\n\n\n=== Football in the amateur era (1912–1933) ===\n\nThe new team trained on Russel Beach and gradually gained the support of the locals, who closely watched their practice matches. The first official match was played on May 3, 1912, and marked, to this day, the largest margin of victory in the club's history, as they defeated Mangueira 16–2. Flamengo's first ever match against Fluminense, the start of the Fla-Flu rivalry, was played on July 7 of that year and was won by Fluminense by a score of 3–2. That same year, Flamengo finished as runners-up of the Campeonato Carioca, the Rio de Janeiro State Championship. The team's first uniform was nicknamed the \"papagaio vintém\", due to its similarity to a particular type of kite. In 1914 the club won the Campeonato Carioca for the first time, dressed in a red, black, and white-striped shirt nicknamed the \"cobra coral\" (coral snake) was worn until 1916. Flamengo won the Campeonato Carioca again in 1915, 1920, and 1921.\nIn 1925, the team won the Campeonato Carioca and five other tournaments, a record at the time. In 1927 the prominent Rio newspaper Jornal do Brasil, in partnership with a mineral water company, held a mail-in contest to find \"the most beloved club in Brazil.\" Though Flamengo enjoyed their largest increase in fan support after the club professionalized in the 1930s, they still defeated popular rivals Vasco da Gama in the vote. This was the first of many times that Flamengo would be polled as the nation's most popular club, originating the nickname \"O mais querido do Brasil\" (\"the most beloved of Brazil\"). In 1933 the team went on its first tour outside Brazil (to Montevideo and Buenos Aires) and on 14 May of the same year played its final match as an amateur team, defeating River Futebol Clube by a score of 16–2. After this, the club's football department became professional.\n\n\n=== Early professional era (1934–1955) ===\n\nLocal advertiser José Bastos Padilha was elected club president in 1934 and served until 1937. Under his tenure, the club massively improved its popularity in both Rio de Janeiro and the entirety of Brazil. For publicity, he organized a contest for students in schools to create phrases describing Flamengo, from which the phrase uma vez Flamengo, Flamengo até morrer (\"Once you are Flamengo, you are Flamengo 'til you die\") was developed and would later be adopted as part of the club's anthem. In 1936 Padilha signed excellent players such as Domingos da Guia and Leônidas da Silva (who would go on to be the leading goalscorer in the 1938 FIFA World Cup as a Flamengo player). These beloved players endeared Flamengo to the public and it is believed that by this time Flamengo was the most popular club in the country. In 1937 Flamengo hired Hungarian coach Izidor \"Dori\" Kürschner, who introduced the WM system to Brazil and other innovations from Europe such as training without the use of the ball and playing a more defensive, controlled style. Padilha facilitated the construction of Flamengo's new stadium and current training center, the Estádio da Gávea. The stadium was inaugurated on September 4, 1938, when Vasco da Gama defeated Flamengo 2–0 and Kürschner was promptly fired.\nIn 1938, the five-year split in Rio de Janeiro football over the dispute between professionalism and amateurism was resolved with the merger of the two competing leagues (Flamengo had been a member of the professional LCF - Liga Carioca de Football). In 1939, after twelve years without winning any titles, Flamengo conquered the state championship with a team that would become the basis of the three-time state champions in the 1940s.\nIn 1941, the group played its first international competition, the Hexagonal Tournament of Argentina. In 1942, the first organized supporters group in all of Brazil, Charanga Rubro-Negra, was founded in support of Flamengo. Flamengo's popularity grew incidentally during World War II when Brazil's allies the United States installed two high-powered antennas in Natal and Belém in the north of Brazil to intercept enemy radio signals. They also allowed residents in the North and Northeast regions to receive the radio broadcasts of football matches. As Rio de Janeiro was the national capital at the time and Flamengo was highly successful in the war years with Zizinho and Domingos da Guia, nationwide support increased. In 1944, Flamengo completed their first tricampeonato Carioca: three consecutive Rio de Janeiro state titles (winning the 1942, 1943, and 1944 competitions). The key player of this squad was Zizinho, a player developed at Flamengo and considered the first ever \"idol\" of the club. Zizinho was transferred to Bangu just before the start of the 1950 World Cup in Brazil, where he scored twice and the Seleção finished runners-up. From 1953 to 1955, Flamengo once again won the Rio de Janeiro State League three consecutive times.\n\n\n=== Developing talent (1956–1973) ===\nDespite the lack of achievements of this period Flamengo continued to grow in influence regionally, particularly due to their popular roster of players such as Dida, Carlinhos, Paulo Cézar Caju, Gérson, Antônio Rondinelli, Horácio Doval, Fio Maravilha, Evaristo de Macedo, Francisco Reyes and others. Throughout the 1950s, Flamengo played in several international invitational tournaments against South American and European competition.The top football clubs in Brazil were largely concentrated in the Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo areas. As early as 1911 there have been several inter-state cup matches between clubs from the two municipalities. In 1955 Flamengo won their first Rio-São Paulo State Champions' Cup against Santos and in 1961 they captured the more prestigious Torneio Rio – São Paulo, which at the time assembled the best teams in Brazil and was the predecessor tournament for the eventual Brazilian Championship in 1971 (the Taça Brasil, established in 1959, served as the current format for determining a national champion and participant in the newly-formed CONMEBOL Copa Libertadores). Flamengo won the 1963 Campeonato Carioca and qualified for the following Taça Brasil for the first time, finishing runners-up behind Pelé's Santos.\nIn late 1968, the legendary Garrincha was signed by Flamengo on a season-long contract, but he only made 20 appearances with four goals. The legacy of the club in the 1970s would be the fantastic class of young players to graduate from Flamengo's youth ranks to later form the backbone of Flamengo's \"golden generation.\" In this period, players like Zico, Júnior, Leandro and others were promoted to the senior team.\n\n\n=== Zico and the world champions (1974–1983) ===\n\nFlamengo won their 18th Campeonato Carioca state championship in 1978. The following five years would come to represent the club's most glorious era. Brazilian stars like Júnior, Carpegiani, Adílio, Cláudio Adão and Tita were led by Zico to become state champions three times in a row - the club's third tri-championship. This run of sustained excellent play pushed Flamengo towards its first Brazilian Championship in 1980. As national champions, the club qualified to play in the South American continental tournament, the 1981 Copa Libertadores, for the first time.\nThe 1981 season is a benchmark year in Flamengo's history. They advanced through the semi-final group stage of the Copa Libertadores with four victories in four matches. In the final they encountered Chilean club Cobreloa, also a debutante club in the tournament. In the first final at the Maracanã, Flamengo prevailed (2–1) with two goals from Zico. In the National Stadium in Santiago the following week, the Brazilian team received a violent reception on the field and fell 1–0 from a free kick. Equal on goals, a third match was played at the neutral venue of the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo. Zico scored twice in the first half, sealing the game and the championship. Flamengo were crowned champions of South America on November 23 and qualified for the Intercontinental Cup, a single match to be played in Tokyo's Olympic Stadium against European Champions' Cup winner Liverpool FC.\nOn December 13, 1981, Zico, Tita, and Nunes took the field for the most important match in the club's history. Two goals by Nunes and one by Adílio (all in the first half) along with a brilliant midfield performance by Zico earned Flamengo the title of first Brazilian World Champions since Pelé's Santos, shutting out Liverpool 3–0.The following two years were also marked with success. One more Rio de Janeiro State Championship in 1981 and two Brazilian Championships – 1982 and 1983 – closed Flamengo's \"Golden Age.\"\n\n\n=== National success and the return of Zico (1984–1994) ===\n\nAfter two years playing in Italy for Udinese, Zico returned to the Flamengo in 1986 and won his last state championship. Only one month after returning, he suffered a severe knee injury after a violent tackle from Bangu defender Marcio Nunes, which interrupted his career for several months and affected his form in the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIn 1987, Zico was a major contributor to Flamengo's victory in the first edition of the Copa União. That year, the CBF was experiencing serious financial and institutional crises and was unable to secure sponsorship to organize the national championship as in years prior. As a result, the thirteen biggest clubs in Brazil (which included Flamengo) reacted and created a new entity named the Club of 13 to organize a championship of their own. The CBF originally supported the decision by the Club of 13, but were pressured by other clubs to create a larger national tournament. As a result, CBF placed three additional clubs into the Copa União, regarded the Copa União as the \"Green Module,\" and organized a second \"Yellow Module\" of 16 other teams. For the 1987 Brazilian Championship, the winners and runners-up of both modules would face each other in a knockout-style cup to determine the national champion and qualification for the Copa Libertadores. With strong performances from Zico, Zé Carlos, Renato Gaúcho and Bebeto, Flamengo conquered the Copa União with major victories over Internacional and Atlético Mineiro. However, there was a dispute over whether Flamengo and Internacional of the Green Module would dispute the quadrangular against Sport Recife and Guarani of the Yellow Module. The Club of 13 clubs had agreed to not participate in the final set up by the CBF, but Eurico Miranda, a representative of Vasco and the Club of 13, had already signed an agreement with CBF regarding the final. Flamengo still did not participate in the final under the understanding that it would only determine the entrants of the Copa Libertadores and not the Brazilian national champion. CBF officially recognized Sport as the sole champion in 1987 and they qualified to the Copa Libertadores. In 2011, CBF retroactively declared Flamengo co-champion of 1987. However, Sport later appealed the decision and CBF ultimately declared Sport as the sole champion of that year.Throughout his career at Flamengo, Zico scored 508 goals and was the top scorer in club history before retiring in 1990.Even without its biggest star, the early years of the post-Zico era were successful for Flamengo. They achieved national victory in the second edition of the Copa do Brasil in 1990, defeating Goiás in the finals. In 1992, Flamengo won their fourth Campeonato Brasileiro, defeating Botafogo across two legs in the final (3–0, 2–2). The team's key player was again Júnior at 38 years old.\n\n\n=== Risk of relegation (1995–2005) ===\nAfter the Brazilian League title in 1992, the club entered a major financial crisis and domestic and international achievements became less frequent. In 1995, the year of Flamengo's centenary, radio sports broadcaster Kléber Leite became chairman of the club and signed striker Romário, the current FIFA World Player of the Year, from Barcelona. He joined Sávio and later Edmundo to become, as the supporters called, \"the attack of dreams\". Even with Romário and other stars, Flamengo's centennial year did not yield major trophies. Flamengo only won the Taça Guanabara, the first phase of the Rio de Janeiro State League. Flamengo also finished runners-up of 1995 Supercopa Libertadores. However, in 1996, Flamengo went undefeated in the Campeonato Carioca, conquering both the Taça Guanabara and Taça Rio phases. Romário was the top scorer of the tournament. Sávio was the top scorer and best player in Flamengo's victorious 1996 Copa de Oro campaign. The Copa de Oro was Flamengo's first international success since 1981, their third overall international title.In 1999, Edmundo dos Santos Silva was elected club president, and brought with him a massive contract with sports marketing company ISL. Despite poor campaigns in the Campeonato Brasileiro, Flamengo won the 1999 Copa Mercosur, the second-tier cup of South America, and continued to be successful at the regional level, winning the triple in state championships (1999-2000-2001) for the fourth time as well the 2001 Copa dos Campeões inter-state title. In 2001 league play, Flamengo avoided relegation to the Brazilian Série B by winning against Palmeiras the final match of the tournament. The club suffered a series of bad campaigns in the national league in the following years.\nISL went bankrupt in 2002 for reasons unrelated to their contract with Flamengo, and the club was left without its wealthy partner. In the same year, Edmundo Santos Silva was removed from his role as president in a controversial manner amidst accusation of impropriety. Lacking the funds to make key signings, Flamengo failed to field competitive teams and narrowly avoided relegation in the 2002, 2004, and 2005 campaigns. 2005 was one of the worst seasons in Flamengo's history. The club only escaped relegation after the arrival of coach Joel Santana, who directed the team to six wins and three draws in nine matches played under his command. Twice in this low period, in 2003 and 2004, the team reached the finals of the Copa do Brasil, ultimately falling to Cruzeiro and Santo André.\n\n\n=== End of the drought (2006–2018) ===\n\nIn 2006, Flamengo reached the final of the Copa do Brazil for a fifth time, yet managed to conquer the title against rivals Vasco da Gama. From 2007 to 2009 Flamengo completed their fifth and most recent tricampeonato in the Carioca state league, and became sole owners of the record for most Carioca titles with 31 (Fluminense had 30 at the time).\nOn March 9, 2007, Flamengo received a commemorative date on the Rio de Janeiro (state) official calendar. Governor Sérgio Cabral Filho declared November 17 (the day the club was founded) \"Flamengo Day\".\nIn the 2007 Brazilian Série A, Flamengo won many games at home, escaped the relegation zone and climbed to 2nd place before being defeated by Náutico 1–0 in the final round and ultimately ending the season 3rd. This marked a dramatic improvement in league outcome from previous seasons. Flamengo finished 5th the following year, and in 2009 after finishing the first half of the Brazilian Série A in 10th place, Flamengo won the title. With this victory Flamengo became five-time Brazilian League champions 17 years after their last title in 1992. The 2009 championship team finished the season with 67 points, the lowest winning point total in Brazil since the current league format was established in 2003. Flamengo were champions despite spending only two rounds at the top of the league: the final two. The title was won after a dramatic 2–1 come-from-behind victory against Grêmio in the final round.\n\nInternational success continued to elude Flamengo through the 21st century. After finishing runners-up in the 2001 Copa Mercosur to San Lorenzo on penalties, the club survived as far the quarter-finals only one time in their following twelve competitions (both Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana). In 2008 in Flamengo's first official tournament tie against a club from Mexico, they defeated Club América 4–2 in the Estadio Azteca before losing polemically 3–0 at home and being eliminated in the Copa Libertadores round of 16.\nFlamengo experienced a poor run in Série A from 2010 to 2015, finishing better than 10th only once. Following the success of 2009, the club gambled on winning several titles and signed striker Vágner Love to form a pair with Adriano. The dream of repeating as state champions four times in a row was foiled by Botafogo in 2010. After narrowly qualifying out of the group stage in the Copa Libertadores, manager Andrade was still fired. In their first quarter-final appearance since 1993, Flamengo were eliminated by Universidad de Chile. Shortly after, Vágner Love and Adriano left the team. A series of coaching changes during the troublesome domestic league saw Flamengo survive relegation and claim the final berth to the Copa Sudamericana under manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo.\nThe blockbuster signing of 2011 was 30-year-old superstar Ronaldinho from A.C. Milan. He was joined by Argentine Darío Bottinelli and Fluminense idol Thiago Neves. Flamengo won the Campeonato Carioca outright in an undefeated campaign, but captured no other trophies that season: eliminations in the Copa do Brasil by Ceará and the Sudamericana by Universidad de Chile, and a fourth-place finish in the league left fans feeling that a strong roster had been squandered. The season saw the retirement of Serbian club idol Dejan Petković as well. In 2012 Ronaldinho sued Flamengo claiming lack of payment for four months and canceled his contract with the club, Thiago Neves returned to Fluminense after a drawn-out negotiation with contract-holders Al-Hilal, and defender Alex Silva was loaned to Cruzeiro after threatening Flamengo with a lawsuit. Vágner Love and Ibson returned for a 2012 campaign that yielded no trophies and a group-stage exit from the Libertadores.\nAt the end of 2012, Flamengo elected Eduardo Bandeira de Mello as club president for three years. The goal of his term was to improve the club's finances, after an independent audit assessed Flamengo's debt at R$750 million. After a typical series of managerial changes, Jayme de Almeida was appointed as interim manager during which he fought off relegation and won the 2013 Copa do Brasil final against Atlético Paranaense. It was Flamengo's third Copa title, after 1990 and 2006.\nFlamengo's Copa do Brasil title-defense fell short to Atlético Mineiro in the semi-final. However, by 2014, Flamengo was the only club that successfully reduced their debt over the year (down to R$600 million) and recorded the highest annual profit. In 2015 after an inconsistent start to the Carioca and national league seasons, multiple managers were dismissed and Flamengo failed to qualify for the Libertadores. However, Flamengo had signed Paolo Guerrero and Ederson and were the most valuable club in Brazil with debt now reduced to R$495 million. As a result, president Bandeira was re-elected. The club signed fan-favorite Diego in the mid-season and mounted a strong campaign, but could not catch Palmeiras in 2016.\n2017 was characterized as the year Flamengo played two major finals at the end of the season but failed to win either. After going undefeated in the 2017 Campeonato Carioca, they were eliminated in the Libertadores group stage, failing to win a single match away from home but qualifying for the Copa Sudamericana in third place. In the Copa do Brasil, the club reached the final where they lost in a penalty shootout to Cruzeiro. Less than three months later, the reached an unprecedented Copa Sudamericana final. They lost away to Independiente and drew at home 1–1, losing the title. After the match, a group of Flamengo supporters rioted outside the hotel where Independiente were staying. CONMEBOL punished the club with two closed-door home matches in the following Copa Libertadores.Nine years after their last Campeonato Brasileiro victory, Flamengo made a title run but fell just short. In 2018 they spent the most rounds as league leader (thirteen) and broke their points record from 2016 (72), but finished runners-up behind Palmeiras. That season, the club recorded their two highest outgoing transfer fees in history: 18-year-old winger Vinícius Júnior moved to Real Madrid in July for €46 million, and 20-year-old midfielder Lucas Paquetá transferred to Milan for a reported €35 million at the end of the year. Both were products of Flamengo's youth academy.\n\n\n=== New glory (2019–present) ===\nOn the morning of February 8, 2019, a fire erupted at Flamengo's Ninho do Urubu training center living quarters. The fire resulted in the deaths of ten academy players between the ages of 14 and 17 training with the club. Three others were injured. The cause of the fire was a malfunctioning air-conditioning unit that caught fire in the room of one of the victims close to 5:00 am. President Rodolfo Landim described it as \"the worst tragedy the club has ever experienced in its 123 years.\" The governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro declared a three-day period of mourning following the tragedy.The 2019 season marked the most successful one in the club's footballing history. At the end of 2018, Rodolfo Landim was elected club president for a three-year term. Flamengo paid the most expensive incoming transfer fee for a player in Brazilian football history, signing Giorgian De Arrascaeta from Cruzeiro for R$63 million (€14.5 million). In January the club signed forward Bruno Henrique from Santos and secured the loan of striker Gabriel \"Gabigol\" Barbosa from Inter Milan.After narrowly advancing out of the Copa Libertadores group stage, manager Abel Braga resigned and Flamengo hired Portuguese manager Jorge Jesus. Europe-based players Rafinha, Filipe Luís, Pablo Marí and Gerson were added to play alongside Flamengo's other record signings. After qualifying to their first Copa Libertadores semi-final since 1984, Flamengo defeated Grêmio 5–0 in their home leg at the Maracanã to advance their first Libertadores final since 1981. For the first time in Copa Libertadores history, the final was played as a single match in a neutral venue. On November 23, 2019 at the Estadio Monumental in Lima, Peru against defending champions River Plate, Flamengo trailed 0–1 in the final minutes before Gabriel scored twice to secure the historic 2–1 victory.Less than 24 hours later, Flamengo became champions of the Campeonato Brasileiro for the first time since 2009 with four matches in hand after a loss by Palmeiras to Grêmio in the 34th round. Flamengo became only the second Brazilian club to win their state championship (2019 Campeonato Carioca), Campeonato Brasileiro, and Copa Libertadores in the same season, after Pelé's 1962 Santos team. Flamengo's 2019 campaign under Jorge Jesus' leadership broke a number of records in the Campeonato Brasileiro's 20-team double round-robin era (2006–present): most points (90), most wins (28), most goals scored (86), best goal differential (+49), longest undefeated streak (24 matches), most points clear of runners-up (16) and most goals by a single player (25 from Gabriel Barbosa).Flamengo participated in the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time in the club's history in 2019 in Qatar. The club defeated Al Hilal SFC 3–1 in the semi-final, but lost 0–1 to Liverpool in the final.\n\n\n== Crest and uniforms ==\n\n\n=== Crest ===\nFlamengo's crest has changed slightly throughout the club's history. Most of the changes has been changes to the interlocked letters monogram, with the latest redesign being unveiled in 2018.The club uses three crests in different situations: the full crest is used as the club's official logo, the rowing crest is used for all rowing related uniforms and equipment, and the white \"CRF\" monogram is typically the only component of the crest worn on the primary football uniform.\nBeginning in 1980, Flamengo wore three white stars aligned vertically along the side of their monogram crest to indicate their three state league tri-championships (1942–43–44, 1953–54–55, and 1978–79–79 Special). When Nike became Flamengo's kit provider in 2000, their first kit featured the full shield crest with three stars above it for the first time. In 2001 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the 1981 Copa Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup championships, a gold star was introduced above the crest. In 2005 the club returned to primarily using only the \"CRF\" monogram crest on their shirts. The single gold star continues to feature above the crest.\n\n\n=== Uniforms ===\nAt the 1895 meeting which established the Flamengo rowing club, the club's official colors were decided as blue and gold to symbolized the sky of Rio de Janeiro and the riches of Brazil. The team adopted a uniform of thick blue and gold horizontal stripes. However Flamengo failed to win a single regatta in their first year and gained the nickname of \"bronze club.\" The team colors were perceived as bad luck, and the colored fabric was expensive to import from England. One year after the club's establishment, the official colors were replaced with the current red and black.\nIn 1912, at the request of the Flamengo rowing team (who opposed the use of their same uniform by the newly established football team), the football players dressed in shirts divided into red and black quarters which became known as the papagaio de vintém uniform, named after a particular style of kite. However the shirt became synonymous with bad luck and was replaced in 1913 by a shirt with red and black horizontal stripes and thinner white bands. This uniform was nicknamed the cobra coral due to its similarity to the pattern of a coral snake. This was the uniform worn when Flamengo won their first Campeonato Carioca title in 1914. The white bands were removed from the shirt in 1916 as the pattern was very similar to the flag of Germany at the time, who Brazil was allied against in World War I. The rowing team permitted the football team to use their same uniform, and Flamengo's traditional football uniform of a red and black striped shirt, white shorts and red-black socks was born.In 1938, Flamengo manager Dori Kruschner suggested the creation of a secondary white uniform to \"improve the visibility in night matches.\" The new uniform was approved by the club, and Flamengo became a pioneer of secondary uniforms in Brazil. The white shirt had two red and black stripes across the chest until 1979 when it was changed to a plain white chest with stripes on the sleeves. This was the shirt worn by the team that won the 1981 Intercontinental Cup.\nBeginning in the 1990s the club began to experiment with their second and third alternative uniforms, sometimes wearing all black or all red shirts. In 1995 for the club's centenary, a \"papagaio de vintém\" shirt was worn in friendlies. In 2010 uniform supplier Olympikus introduced a blue and gold alternative uniform which paid homage to Flamengo's original colors and regatta uniform, however it was not well-received by fans who likened it to the uniform worn by the fictional satirical team \"Tabajara\" on the popular comedy program Casseta & Planeta Urgente. In the first half of the 2009 season, the team wore a uniform without sponsorship for the first time in 25 years. Flamengo have continued to traditionally wear red and black striped shirts with white shorts as their primary uniform.\n\n\n=== Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors ===\nThe following is a list of Flamengo's sponsors and uniform suppliers.\n\n\n=== Uniform deals ===\n\n\n== Stadiums ==\n\n\n=== Rua Paysandu ===\nFlamengo's first official home ground was the Estádio da Rua Paysandu (\"Paysandu Street Stadium\"). The ground formerly belonged to Paissandu Atlético Clube before they ceased playing football in 1914. The owners of the ground rented the field to Flamengo where they played their home matches from 1915 to 1932. Between 1912 and 1915 (and later between 1932 and 1938), the club played all their matches on the grounds of Botafogo or Fluminense. The first Flamengo match at Rua Paysandu was played on October 31, 1915 in the Campeonato Carioca against Bangu. Crowds of 15,000 watched Flamengo face Fluminese at the park in 1918 and 1919.\n\n\n=== Estádio da Gávea ===\n\nFlamengo's home stadium is nominally the Estádio da Gávea (officially named the Estádio José Bastos Padilha at Flamengo's Gávea Headquarters), which was inaugurated on September 4, 1938, and has a capacity of 4,000 people. The stadium is named after José Bastos Padilha, Flamengo's president at the time of the stadium's construction, from 1933 to 1937. Even though Flamengo no longer play their matches at Gávea, the site serves as the club's administrative headquarters. Since the 1990s, the stadium has been used almost exclusively for the club's youth and women's teams' matches, and as the training ground for the senior team. Most matches are played at the significantly larger Maracanã Stadium, considered by supporters as the real Flamengo home ground. Gávea Stadium is not actually located in the neighborhood of Gávea but rather in Leblon.\nDuring the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the Dutch National Team used the Estádio da Gávea and all of its facilities as their training ground in preparation for the competition.\n\n\n=== Maracanã ===\n\nSince its construction for the 1950 World Cup, the Maracanã has primarily served as the home ground for the four biggest Rio de Janeiro clubs. The stadium was officially completed in 1965, 17 years after construction began. In 1963, more than 194,000 people attended a match between Flamengo and Fluminense at the Maracanã. The capacity of the stadium allowed Flamengo to have the largest support of any clubs in Brazil for much of the 20th century. In 1989 Zico scored his final goal in the historic stadium, setting the current unbroken record for goals in the Maracanã at 333. An upper stand in the stadium collapsed on July 19, 1992, in the second match of the finals of 1992 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A between Botafogo and Flamengo, leading to the death of three spectators and injuring 50 others. Following the disaster, the stadium's capacity was greatly reduced as it was converted to an all-seater stadium in the late 1990s. Following its 50th anniversary in 2000, the stadium underwent renovations which would increase its full capacity to around 103,000. After years of planning and nine months of closure between 2005 and 2006 (during which Flamengo played their home matches at Volta Redonda's Estádio Raulino de Oliveira and Portuguesa's Estádio Luso Brasileiro), the stadium was reopened in January 2007 with an all-seated capacity of 87,000. For the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics and Paralympics, a major reconstruction project was initiated in 2010. The original seating bowl, with a two-tier configuration, was demolished, giving way to a new one-tier seating bowl.The stadium is officially under the management of Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht as of 2013. This has resulted in unfavorable rental agreements for Flamengo who do not officially administer the stadium and often owe rental fees for matches in excess of their ticket revenue, even for matches with high attendance. The most recent rental agreement was signed in 2018 and is valid through 2020. In April 2019, Flamengo and Fluminense came to an agreement with the state and the operators of the Maracanã to serve as joint-managers of the venue for the following six months, a deal which allowed the clubs to pay a fixed monthly fee and receive a higher share of matchday revenue than was granted under the previous deal.\n\n\n=== Ilha do Urubu ===\n\nIn 2017, Flamengo played their home matches at the Estádio Luso Brasileiro of Portuguesa while disputing their stadium situation with the Rio de Janeiro state government and Complexo Maracanã Entretenimento S.A. (composed of Odebrecht, IMX, AEG), the operator of the Maracanã Stadium. A three-year agreement was signed with Portuguesa over management of Estádio Luso Brasileiro, named Ilha do Urubu (\"Vulture's Island\") by Flamengo supporters in a poll. The park was renovated to fit 20,500 spectators. Flamengo started playing at the arena in March 2017, but after several delays and administrative issues and a new contract with the Maracanã, Flamengo broke their lease with the Ilha do Urubu in July 2018.\n\n\n== Rivalries ==\n\n\n=== Rivalry with Vasco da Gama ===\n\nThe Clássico dos Milhões (English: \"Derby of Millions\") is the traditional Brazilian derby between Flamengo and Vasco da Gama, both from Rio de Janeiro. It is considered one of the biggest rivalries in Brazilian football and in football worldwide. The derby's name originated in the 1920s and refers to the two largest fanbases in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Both clubs were established in the late 19th century as regatta rowing clubs. The first football match between the clubs was played in 1923 when Vasco entered the top division of the Carioca state league. From the 1972 to 2001, the matchup was elevated as the most important of Flamengo's rivalries (surpassing Fluminense) and became one of the biggest rivalries in all of Brazil. In this span, Flamengo and Vasco played in or won the final of each of the phases of the state championship nearly every year, frequently facing one another. This also coincided with the beginnings of the national Campeonato Brasileiro and the growth in popularity of both clubs nationwide. The most iconic matches between Flamengo and Vasco featured the idols of both clubs challenging each other: Zico of Flamengo (1971–83; 85–89) and Roberto Dinamite of Vasco da Gama (1971–79; 80–93).\n\n\n=== Rivalry with Fluminense ===\n\nThe rivalry between these two clubs began in October 1911 when a group of dissatisfied players from Fluminense left their club and joined Flamengo, establishing the football department at their new club. The first Fla–Flu ever was played the following year on July 7. Fluminense won the match 3–2, with 800 people in attendance. Flamengo and Fluminense are the two most successful team in the Campeonato Carioca: as of 2019 Flamengo have 35 state league titles and Fluminense have 31. In 1963, the Maracanã held 194,603 spectators to watch the Fla-Flu match.\n\n\n=== Rivalry with Botafogo ===\nThe first confrontation between Rio de Janeiro rivals Flamengo and Botafogo occurred in 1913. The match became known as the Clássico da Rivaldade (English: \"Rivalry Classic\") in the 1960s. Flamengo's mascot of the vulture originated during the June 1, 1969 match against Botafogo when Flamengo supporters released a vulture onto the field in response to the racist cheers of urubu (vulture) from the Botafogo supporters. Flamengo's top scorer in the derby is Zico and Botafogo's top scorer is Heleno de Freitas.\n\n\n=== Rivalry with Atlético Mineiro ===\n\nFlamengo has an inter-state rivalry with Atlético Mineiro of Minas Gerais, developed in the 1980s from numerous controversial encounters between the two clubs in that decade's Campeonato Brasileiro and Copa Libertadores editions. It maintained its high intensity through the following years, and is considered one of the biggest interstate rivalries in Brazilian football.\n\n\n== Supporters ==\n\nSince the early 1990s, surveys have shown that Flamengo is consistently the most supported club in Brazil with an estimated more than 30 million fans. In a 2018 survey, 23% of football fans in Brazil consider themselves supporters of Flamengo, with high levels of support in the North and Northeast regions, in addition to Rio de Janeiro. Flamengo supporters are known as Nação Rubro-Negra (English: Red-Black Nation).\nThe first organized supporters group in all of Brazil, Charanga Rubro-Negra (Red-Black Charanga Band), was founded in support of Flamengo in 1942. Since then, a large number of additional organized supporters groups have formed around Flamengo, notably Torcida Jovem-Fla (Young-Fla Firm), Urubuzada (Vultures), Flamanguaça (FlaBooze), and Raça Rubro-Negra (Red-Black Race).\nIn 2007 Flamengo supporters were declared as part of the cultural heritage of the city of Rio de Janeiro, along with bossa nova and Bola Preta, the oldest Carnival block in Rio.In the 1983 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A final, Flamengo played against Santos in the Maracanã in front of an official crowd of 155,523 with some estimates of over 160,000 people in attendance. The largest ever attendance for a Flamengo match was against Fluminense in 1963 with 194,603 spectators. Flamengo matches in the Maracanã have broken the 150,000 attendance mark thirteen times.\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== First team squad ===\nAs of 5 March 2020Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

The club had dozens of presidents, with variable permanence time. From 1895 to 1932, the terms lasted one year, from 1933 to 1956 two years, from 1957 to 1968 three years, from 1969 to 2000 was again two years and starting from 2001 again three years.\n\n\n== Other sports ==\n\n\n=== Men's basketball ===\n\nFlamengo basketball won the Rio de Janeiro City Championship in 1919 and have since grown to be one of the most successful and supported basketball teams in the country. The club have won six Brazilian Championships, a record 44 Rio de Janeiro State Championships, the 1953 South American Championship of Champions Clubs, and the 2009 South American League.In 2014, Flamengo won the League of the Americas without a single loss, defeating Pinheiros in the final. This qualified Flamengo to their first Intercontinental Cup against EuroLeague champions Maccabi Tel Aviv. Flamengo won and became the second Brazilian basketball team in history to be world champions. Flamengo, Real Madrid and Barcelona are the only clubs to have won the Intercontinental Cups in both football and basketball.Flamengo hosted and participated in the 2019 FIBA Intercontinental Cup, falling to BCL champions AEK Athens in the final.\n\n\n==== Honours ====\nNovo Basquete Brasil (NBB): 62009, 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2018-19Copa Super 8: 12018Campeonato Brasileiro de Basquete: 12008FIBA Americas League: 12014FIBA Intercontinental Cup: 12014\n\n\n=== Women's football ===\n\nBetween 1995 and 2001, the Flamengo women's football team competed in the Campeonato Carioca. In 2002 the women's Carioca tournament was not organized, and the club ceased operation of the team. Flamengo attempted to re-established their women's professional football department in 2011 through a partnership with the city of Guarujá where the team trained and hoped to sign Marta, but the team never materialized. In 2015 president Eduardo Bandeira de Mello succeeded in establishing the football team through a partnership with the Brazilian Navy. In their first season, the team won the women's Campeonato Carioca state championship and have won it every season from 2015 to 2019. In 2016 Flamengo won the Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Feminino for the first time against Rio Preto, become the only club outside the state of São Paulo to win the tournament since its creation in 2013. Flamengo also competed in the 2016 and 2017 Copa do Brasil de Futebol Feminino before the cancellation of the competition in favor of the Campeonato Brasileiro.\n\n\n==== Honors ====\nCampeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Feminino: 12016Campeonato Carioca de Futebol Feminino: 52015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\n\n\n=== Women's basketball ===\nThe Flamengo women's basketball team won back-to-back Brazilian championships in 1954 and 1955. Ten years later with some of the same players, the program won back-to-back Brazilian titles again in 1964 and 1965. Flamengo players Norminha, Angelina, Marlene and Delei were champions of the 1967 Pan American Games in Winnipeg with the Brazil women's national basketball team.\nIn 1966 Flamengo won the Inter-club Basketball World Championship. The team was led by Angelina, considered one of the best players of her time.\n\n\n=== Rowing ===\n\nThe \"Flamengo Regatta Group\", later renamed the \"Flamengo Regatta Club\", was established in 1895 as Flamengo's first ever organized athletic department, forming the basis of the club's history and identity to this day. The first regatta victory came in 1898 in the Nautical Championship of Brazil, and the first title was won in 1900, the Regatta of the IV Centenary of the Discovery of Brazil, for which the club was awarded the Jug Tropon trophy. In 1905 the club won a classic event, the South American Cup. By 1908, Flamengo had already won 43 gold, 126 silver and 141 bronze medals. The success of the rowing club made the team famous even before the founding of the football department in 1911. Great rowers such as Everardo Paes de Lima, Arnaldo Voigt, Alfredo Correia (\"Boca Larga\"), Ângelo Gammaro (\"Angelú\") and Antônio Rebello Junior (\"Engole Garfo\") came through Flamengo, the latter three being considered Brazilian sports heroes for completing the Rio-Santos crossing in 1932.\nFrom 1931 to 1937 Flamengo were seven-time champions of Rio de Janeiro, and were four-time repeat state champions from 1940 to 1943. In 1963 the \"Buck era\" began, which revolutionized Flamengo rowing. The coach brought in athletes from other states and renovated the club's facilities to better accommodate the boats. Buck was coach of the Brazilian National Team, directing the team in several international competitions. In the early 1980s, Flamengo won the state championship and won again in 1992. The club has won the men's Brazil Trophy 10 times, and the female once, in addition to 45 Carioca state titles.\n\n\n=== Water polo ===\nWater polo is the second oldest sport practiced by the club, after rowing. The team played their first game on May 27, 1913 in Rio de Janeiro, and defeated Clube Internacional de Regatas, 3–2. Flamengo only opened its water sports facility in 1965. Prior to that, athletes played and trained in the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon or in the sea. Flamengo's first polo championship in Rio de Janeiro came in 1985 and was the start of a run of nine consecutive championships through 1993. In 1985 the club won the South American Club Championship and the Brazil Trophy (also won four consecutive times). A female water polo team was established in 1987, winning the Brazil Trophy in 1987 and 1991 and the state championship in 1995.\n\n\n=== American football ===\nThe club launched their American football team in 2013, forming a partnership with the Rio de Janeiro Emperors. The Emperors were established in 2008 and had previously partnered with Fluminense from 2010 to 2013. The team officially goes by the name of the Flamengo Emperors and compete in the BFA (Brasil Futebol Americano).\n\n\n=== Tennis ===\nFlamengo began playing tennis championships in 1916 and became three-time Rio champions soon after (1916–18), even with their athletes training at other clubs. Until 1932 the club practiced tennis on their football field at the Rua Paysandu. In 1963 the club inaugurated their own facilities and courts. The biggest idol of Flamengo's tennis department is Thomas Koch.\n\n\n=== E-sports ===\n\nIn 2017 the club announced they would be entering the increasingly popular e-sports leagues the following year, beginning with a League of Legends department and eventually establishing a PES team. Because the competitive League of Legends center of Brazil is at the Riot Games studio in São Paulo, Flamengo established a permanent \"gaming office\" for the team in the city. Flamengo announced that they would not be partnering with an existing team but rather would have their own team. In October 2017 they announced the purchase of Merciless Gaming, a team in the 2nd division of the Brazilian League of Legends championship.\n\n\n=== Additional sports departments ===\nArtistic gymnastics\nAuto racing (Flamengo Superleague Formula team)\nBeach soccer\nBocce\nCP football\nFutsal\nIndoor soccer\nJudo\nSwimming\nSynchronised swimming\nVolleyball\n\n\n== See also ==\nClássico dos Milhões\nFla-Flu\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website","sourceContentSanitized":"Clube de Regatas do Flamengo , commonly referred to as Flamengo, is a Brazilian sports club based in Rio de Janeiro best known for their professional football team. The club was first established in 1895 as a rowing club and played their first official match in 1912. Flamengo's traditional uniform features red and black striped shirts with white shorts, and red and black striped socks. Flamengo has typically played their home matches in the Maracanã, the national stadium of Brazil, since its completion in 1950, with some exceptions in recent years. Since 1969, the vulture has been the most recognized mascot of Flamengo.Flamengo established themselves as one of Brazil's most successful sports clubs in the 20th century during of the era of state leagues in Brazil when they captured several Campeonato Carioca titles prior to the establishment of the first Brazilian national football league in 1959. Since then, they have remained successful in Brazilian football, having won 7 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, 3 Copa do Brasil, and a record 35 Campeonato Carioca. They are one of three clubs to have never been relegated from the Brasileirão. In South American and worldwide competitions, the club's highest achievements are their conquests of the 1981 and 2019 Copa Libertadores, and 1981 Intercontinental Cup against Liverpool, led by the club's most iconic player Zico. Flamengo's fiercest and longest-standing rivalries are with the other \"Big Four\" of Rio de Janeiro: Fluminense, Botafogo and Vasco da Gama. Flamengo is the most popular club in Brazil, with over 30 million supporters as of 2018. As of 2017, it is also Brazil's richest football club with an annual revenue of R$648.0 million and a valuation of over R$1.69 billion . Flamengo was founded on November 17, 1895, by a group of rowers gathered at club member Nestor de Barros's manor on Flamengo Beach in Rio de Janeiro. In the late 19th century, rowing was the elite sport in the region and the group hoped to impress the young women of the city's high society by establishing a rowing club. Previously, they could only afford a used boat named Pherusa, which had to be completely rebuilt before it could be used in competition. The team debuted on October 6, 1895, when they sailed off the Caju Point toward Flamengo Beach. However, strong winds turned over the boat and the rowers nearly drowned. They were rescued by a fishing boat named Leal . Later as the Pherusa was undergoing repairs, it was stolen and never found again. The group saved money to buy a new boat, the Etoile, renamed Scyra. On the night of November 17, the group gathered at Nestor de Barros's manor on Flamengo beach and founded the Grupo de Regatas do Flamengo and elected its first board and president . The name was changed a few weeks later to its current title of Clube de Regatas do Flamengo . The founders decided that the anniversary of the club's foundation should be commemorated on November 15 to coincide with Republic Procalamation Day, a national holiday. Flamengo's football team was only established after a group of ten dissatisfied players from Fluminense broke away from that club following a dispute with its board. The players decided to join Flamengo because Alberto Borgerth, the team's captain, was also a rower for Flamengo. Also, establishing a land sports department at Flamengo was preferable to joining football rivals Botafogo or the all-English club Paissandu. The new members were admitted on November 8, 1911. A motion against the club taking part in football tournaments was defeated, and as a result the members officially established the team on December 24, 1911. The new team trained on Russel Beach and gradually gained the support of the locals, who closely watched their practice matches. The first official match was played on May 3, 1912, and marked, to this day, the largest margin of victory in the club's history, as they defeated Mangueira 16–2. Flamengo's first ever match against Fluminense, the start of the Fla-Flu rivalry, was played on July 7 of that year and was won by Fluminense by a score of 3–2. That same year, Flamengo finished as runners-up of the Campeonato Carioca, the Rio de Janeiro State Championship. The team's first uniform was nicknamed the \"papagaio vintém\", due to its similarity to a particular type of kite. In 1914 the club won the Campeonato Carioca for the first time, dressed in a red, black, and white-striped shirt nicknamed the \"cobra coral\" was worn until 1916. Flamengo won the Campeonato Carioca again in 1915, 1920, and 1921. In 1925, the team won the Campeonato Carioca and five other tournaments, a record at the time. In 1927 the prominent Rio newspaper Jornal do Brasil, in partnership with a mineral water company, held a mail-in contest to find \"the most beloved club in Brazil.\" Though Flamengo enjoyed their largest increase in fan support after the club professionalized in the 1930s, they still defeated popular rivals Vasco da Gama in the vote. This was the first of many times that Flamengo would be polled as the nation's most popular club, originating the nickname \"O mais querido do Brasil\" . In 1933 the team went on its first tour outside Brazil and on 14 May of the same year played its final match as an amateur team, defeating River Futebol Clube by a score of 16–2. After this, the club's football department became professional. Local advertiser José Bastos Padilha was elected club president in 1934 and served until 1937. Under his tenure, the club massively improved its popularity in both Rio de Janeiro and the entirety of Brazil. For publicity, he organized a contest for students in schools to create phrases describing Flamengo, from which the phrase uma vez Flamengo, Flamengo até morrer was developed and would later be adopted as part of the club's anthem. In 1936 Padilha signed excellent players such as Domingos da Guia and Leônidas da Silva . These beloved players endeared Flamengo to the public and it is believed that by this time Flamengo was the most popular club in the country. In 1937 Flamengo hired Hungarian coach Izidor \"Dori\" Kürschner, who introduced the WM system to Brazil and other innovations from Europe such as training without the use of the ball and playing a more defensive, controlled style. Padilha facilitated the construction of Flamengo's new stadium and current training center, the Estádio da Gávea. The stadium was inaugurated on September 4, 1938, when Vasco da Gama defeated Flamengo 2–0 and Kürschner was promptly fired. In 1938, the five-year split in Rio de Janeiro football over the dispute between professionalism and amateurism was resolved with the merger of the two competing leagues . In 1939, after twelve years without winning any titles, Flamengo conquered the state championship with a team that would become the basis of the three-time state champions in the 1940s. In 1941, the group played its first international competition, the Hexagonal Tournament of Argentina. In 1942, the first organized supporters group in all of Brazil, Charanga Rubro-Negra, was founded in support of Flamengo. Flamengo's popularity grew incidentally during World War II when Brazil's allies the United States installed two high-powered antennas in Natal and Belém in the north of Brazil to intercept enemy radio signals. They also allowed residents in the North and Northeast regions to receive the radio broadcasts of football matches. As Rio de Janeiro was the national capital at the time and Flamengo was highly successful in the war years with Zizinho and Domingos da Guia, nationwide support increased. In 1944, Flamengo completed their first tricampeonato Carioca: three consecutive Rio de Janeiro state titles . The key player of this squad was Zizinho, a player developed at Flamengo and considered the first ever \"idol\" of the club. Zizinho was transferred to Bangu just before the start of the 1950 World Cup in Brazil, where he scored twice and the Seleção finished runners-up. From 1953 to 1955, Flamengo once again won the Rio de Janeiro State League three consecutive times. Despite the lack of achievements of this period Flamengo continued to grow in influence regionally, particularly due to their popular roster of players such as Dida, Carlinhos, Paulo Cézar Caju, Gérson, Antônio Rondinelli, Horácio Doval, Fio Maravilha, Evaristo de Macedo, Francisco Reyes and others. Throughout the 1950s, Flamengo played in several international invitational tournaments against South American and European competition.The top football clubs in Brazil were largely concentrated in the Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo areas. As early as 1911 there have been several inter-state cup matches between clubs from the two municipalities. In 1955 Flamengo won their first Rio-São Paulo State Champions' Cup against Santos and in 1961 they captured the more prestigious Torneio Rio – São Paulo, which at the time assembled the best teams in Brazil and was the predecessor tournament for the eventual Brazilian Championship in 1971 . Flamengo won the 1963 Campeonato Carioca and qualified for the following Taça Brasil for the first time, finishing runners-up behind Pelé's Santos. In late 1968, the legendary Garrincha was signed by Flamengo on a season-long contract, but he only made 20 appearances with four goals. The legacy of the club in the 1970s would be the fantastic class of young players to graduate from Flamengo's youth ranks to later form the backbone of Flamengo's \"golden generation.\" In this period, players like Zico, Júnior, Leandro and others were promoted to the senior team. Flamengo won their 18th Campeonato Carioca state championship in 1978. The following five years would come to represent the club's most glorious era. Brazilian stars like Júnior, Carpegiani, Adílio, Cláudio Adão and Tita were led by Zico to become state champions three times in a row - the club's third tri-championship. This run of sustained excellent play pushed Flamengo towards its first Brazilian Championship in 1980. As national champions, the club qualified to play in the South American continental tournament, the 1981 Copa Libertadores, for the first time. The 1981 season is a benchmark year in Flamengo's history. They advanced through the semi-final group stage of the Copa Libertadores with four victories in four matches. In the final they encountered Chilean club Cobreloa, also a debutante club in the tournament. In the first final at the Maracanã, Flamengo prevailed with two goals from Zico. In the National Stadium in Santiago the following week, the Brazilian team received a violent reception on the field and fell 1–0 from a free kick. Equal on goals, a third match was played at the neutral venue of the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo. Zico scored twice in the first half, sealing the game and the championship. Flamengo were crowned champions of South America on November 23 and qualified for the Intercontinental Cup, a single match to be played in Tokyo's Olympic Stadium against European Champions' Cup winner Liverpool FC. On December 13, 1981, Zico, Tita, and Nunes took the field for the most important match in the club's history. Two goals by Nunes and one by Adílio along with a brilliant midfield performance by Zico earned Flamengo the title of first Brazilian World Champions since Pelé's Santos, shutting out Liverpool 3–0.The following two years were also marked with success. One more Rio de Janeiro State Championship in 1981 and two Brazilian Championships – 1982 and 1983 – closed Flamengo's \"Golden Age.\" After two years playing in Italy for Udinese, Zico returned to the Flamengo in 1986 and won his last state championship. Only one month after returning, he suffered a severe knee injury after a violent tackle from Bangu defender Marcio Nunes, which interrupted his career for several months and affected his form in the 1986 FIFA World Cup. In 1987, Zico was a major contributor to Flamengo's victory in the first edition of the Copa União. That year, the CBF was experiencing serious financial and institutional crises and was unable to secure sponsorship to organize the national championship as in years prior. As a result, the thirteen biggest clubs in Brazil reacted and created a new entity named the Club of 13 to organize a championship of their own. The CBF originally supported the decision by the Club of 13, but were pressured by other clubs to create a larger national tournament. As a result, CBF placed three additional clubs into the Copa União, regarded the Copa União as the \"Green Module,\" and organized a second \"Yellow Module\" of 16 other teams. For the 1987 Brazilian Championship, the winners and runners-up of both modules would face each other in a knockout-style cup to determine the national champion and qualification for the Copa Libertadores. With strong performances from Zico, Zé Carlos, Renato Gaúcho and Bebeto, Flamengo conquered the Copa União with major victories over Internacional and Atlético Mineiro. However, there was a dispute over whether Flamengo and Internacional of the Green Module would dispute the quadrangular against Sport Recife and Guarani of the Yellow Module. The Club of 13 clubs had agreed to not participate in the final set up by the CBF, but Eurico Miranda, a representative of Vasco and the Club of 13, had already signed an agreement with CBF regarding the final. Flamengo still did not participate in the final under the understanding that it would only determine the entrants of the Copa Libertadores and not the Brazilian national champion. CBF officially recognized Sport as the sole champion in 1987 and they qualified to the Copa Libertadores. In 2011, CBF retroactively declared Flamengo co-champion of 1987. However, Sport later appealed the decision and CBF ultimately declared Sport as the sole champion of that year.Throughout his career at Flamengo, Zico scored 508 goals and was the top scorer in club history before retiring in 1990.Even without its biggest star, the early years of the post-Zico era were successful for Flamengo. They achieved national victory in the second edition of the Copa do Brasil in 1990, defeating Goiás in the finals. In 1992, Flamengo won their fourth Campeonato Brasileiro, defeating Botafogo across two legs in the final . The team's key player was again Júnior at 38 years old. After the Brazilian League title in 1992, the club entered a major financial crisis and domestic and international achievements became less frequent. In 1995, the year of Flamengo's centenary, radio sports broadcaster Kléber Leite became chairman of the club and signed striker Romário, the current FIFA World Player of the Year, from Barcelona. He joined Sávio and later Edmundo to become, as the supporters called, \"the attack of dreams\". Even with Romário and other stars, Flamengo's centennial year did not yield major trophies. Flamengo only won the Taça Guanabara, the first phase of the Rio de Janeiro State League. Flamengo also finished runners-up of 1995 Supercopa Libertadores. However, in 1996, Flamengo went undefeated in the Campeonato Carioca, conquering both the Taça Guanabara and Taça Rio phases. Romário was the top scorer of the tournament. Sávio was the top scorer and best player in Flamengo's victorious 1996 Copa de Oro campaign. The Copa de Oro was Flamengo's first international success since 1981, their third overall international title.In 1999, Edmundo dos Santos Silva was elected club president, and brought with him a massive contract with sports marketing company ISL. Despite poor campaigns in the Campeonato Brasileiro, Flamengo won the 1999 Copa Mercosur, the second-tier cup of South America, and continued to be successful at the regional level, winning the triple in state championships for the fourth time as well the 2001 Copa dos Campeões inter-state title. In 2001 league play, Flamengo avoided relegation to the Brazilian Série B by winning against Palmeiras the final match of the tournament. The club suffered a series of bad campaigns in the national league in the following years. ISL went bankrupt in 2002 for reasons unrelated to their contract with Flamengo, and the club was left without its wealthy partner. In the same year, Edmundo Santos Silva was removed from his role as president in a controversial manner amidst accusation of impropriety. Lacking the funds to make key signings, Flamengo failed to field competitive teams and narrowly avoided relegation in the 2002, 2004, and 2005 campaigns. 2005 was one of the worst seasons in Flamengo's history. The club only escaped relegation after the arrival of coach Joel Santana, who directed the team to six wins and three draws in nine matches played under his command. Twice in this low period, in 2003 and 2004, the team reached the finals of the Copa do Brasil, ultimately falling to Cruzeiro and Santo André. In 2006, Flamengo reached the final of the Copa do Brazil for a fifth time, yet managed to conquer the title against rivals Vasco da Gama. From 2007 to 2009 Flamengo completed their fifth and most recent tricampeonato in the Carioca state league, and became sole owners of the record for most Carioca titles with 31 . On March 9, 2007, Flamengo received a commemorative date on the Rio de Janeiro official calendar. Governor Sérgio Cabral Filho declared November 17 \"Flamengo Day\". In the 2007 Brazilian Série A, Flamengo won many games at home, escaped the relegation zone and climbed to 2nd place before being defeated by Náutico 1–0 in the final round and ultimately ending the season 3rd. This marked a dramatic improvement in league outcome from previous seasons. Flamengo finished 5th the following year, and in 2009 after finishing the first half of the Brazilian Série A in 10th place, Flamengo won the title. With this victory Flamengo became five-time Brazilian League champions 17 years after their last title in 1992. The 2009 championship team finished the season with 67 points, the lowest winning point total in Brazil since the current league format was established in 2003. Flamengo were champions despite spending only two rounds at the top of the league: the final two. The title was won after a dramatic 2–1 come-from-behind victory against Grêmio in the final round. International success continued to elude Flamengo through the 21st century. After finishing runners-up in the 2001 Copa Mercosur to San Lorenzo on penalties, the club survived as far the quarter-finals only one time in their following twelve competitions . In 2008 in Flamengo's first official tournament tie against a club from Mexico, they defeated Club América 4–2 in the Estadio Azteca before losing polemically 3–0 at home and being eliminated in the Copa Libertadores round of 16. Flamengo experienced a poor run in Série A from 2010 to 2015, finishing better than 10th only once. Following the success of 2009, the club gambled on winning several titles and signed striker Vágner Love to form a pair with Adriano. The dream of repeating as state champions four times in a row was foiled by Botafogo in 2010. After narrowly qualifying out of the group stage in the Copa Libertadores, manager Andrade was still fired. In their first quarter-final appearance since 1993, Flamengo were eliminated by Universidad de Chile. Shortly after, Vágner Love and Adriano left the team. A series of coaching changes during the troublesome domestic league saw Flamengo survive relegation and claim the final berth to the Copa Sudamericana under manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo. The blockbuster signing of 2011 was 30-year-old superstar Ronaldinho from A.C. Milan. He was joined by Argentine Darío Bottinelli and Fluminense idol Thiago Neves. Flamengo won the Campeonato Carioca outright in an undefeated campaign, but captured no other trophies that season: eliminations in the Copa do Brasil by Ceará and the Sudamericana by Universidad de Chile, and a fourth-place finish in the league left fans feeling that a strong roster had been squandered. The season saw the retirement of Serbian club idol Dejan Petković as well. In 2012 Ronaldinho sued Flamengo claiming lack of payment for four months and canceled his contract with the club, Thiago Neves returned to Fluminense after a drawn-out negotiation with contract-holders Al-Hilal, and defender Alex Silva was loaned to Cruzeiro after threatening Flamengo with a lawsuit. Vágner Love and Ibson returned for a 2012 campaign that yielded no trophies and a group-stage exit from the Libertadores. At the end of 2012, Flamengo elected Eduardo Bandeira de Mello as club president for three years. The goal of his term was to improve the club's finances, after an independent audit assessed Flamengo's debt at R$750 million. After a typical series of managerial changes, Jayme de Almeida was appointed as interim manager during which he fought off relegation and won the 2013 Copa do Brasil final against Atlético Paranaense. It was Flamengo's third Copa title, after 1990 and 2006. Flamengo's Copa do Brasil title-defense fell short to Atlético Mineiro in the semi-final. However, by 2014, Flamengo was the only club that successfully reduced their debt over the year and recorded the highest annual profit. In 2015 after an inconsistent start to the Carioca and national league seasons, multiple managers were dismissed and Flamengo failed to qualify for the Libertadores. However, Flamengo had signed Paolo Guerrero and Ederson and were the most valuable club in Brazil with debt now reduced to R$495 million. As a result, president Bandeira was re-elected. The club signed fan-favorite Diego in the mid-season and mounted a strong campaign, but could not catch Palmeiras in 2016. 2017 was characterized as the year Flamengo played two major finals at the end of the season but failed to win either. After going undefeated in the 2017 Campeonato Carioca, they were eliminated in the Libertadores group stage, failing to win a single match away from home but qualifying for the Copa Sudamericana in third place. In the Copa do Brasil, the club reached the final where they lost in a penalty shootout to Cruzeiro. Less than three months later, the reached an unprecedented Copa Sudamericana final. They lost away to Independiente and drew at home 1–1, losing the title. After the match, a group of Flamengo supporters rioted outside the hotel where Independiente were staying. CONMEBOL punished the club with two closed-door home matches in the following Copa Libertadores.Nine years after their last Campeonato Brasileiro victory, Flamengo made a title run but fell just short. In 2018 they spent the most rounds as league leader and broke their points record from 2016 , but finished runners-up behind Palmeiras. That season, the club recorded their two highest outgoing transfer fees in history: 18-year-old winger Vinícius Júnior moved to Real Madrid in July for €46 million, and 20-year-old midfielder Lucas Paquetá transferred to Milan for a reported €35 million at the end of the year. Both were products of Flamengo's youth academy. On the morning of February 8, 2019, a fire erupted at Flamengo's Ninho do Urubu training center living quarters. The fire resulted in the deaths of ten academy players between the ages of 14 and 17 training with the club. Three others were injured. The cause of the fire was a malfunctioning air-conditioning unit that caught fire in the room of one of the victims close to 5:00 am. President Rodolfo Landim described it as \"the worst tragedy the club has ever experienced in its 123 years.\" The governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro declared a three-day period of mourning following the tragedy.The 2019 season marked the most successful one in the club's footballing history. At the end of 2018, Rodolfo Landim was elected club president for a three-year term. Flamengo paid the most expensive incoming transfer fee for a player in Brazilian football history, signing Giorgian De Arrascaeta from Cruzeiro for R$63 million . In January the club signed forward Bruno Henrique from Santos and secured the loan of striker Gabriel \"Gabigol\" Barbosa from Inter Milan.After narrowly advancing out of the Copa Libertadores group stage, manager Abel Braga resigned and Flamengo hired Portuguese manager Jorge Jesus. Europe-based players Rafinha, Filipe Luís, Pablo Marí and Gerson were added to play alongside Flamengo's other record signings. After qualifying to their first Copa Libertadores semi-final since 1984, Flamengo defeated Grêmio 5–0 in their home leg at the Maracanã to advance their first Libertadores final since 1981. For the first time in Copa Libertadores history, the final was played as a single match in a neutral venue. On November 23, 2019 at the Estadio Monumental in Lima, Peru against defending champions River Plate, Flamengo trailed 0–1 in the final minutes before Gabriel scored twice to secure the historic 2–1 victory.Less than 24 hours later, Flamengo became champions of the Campeonato Brasileiro for the first time since 2009 with four matches in hand after a loss by Palmeiras to Grêmio in the 34th round. Flamengo became only the second Brazilian club to win their state championship , Campeonato Brasileiro, and Copa Libertadores in the same season, after Pelé's 1962 Santos team. Flamengo's 2019 campaign under Jorge Jesus' leadership broke a number of records in the Campeonato Brasileiro's 20-team double round-robin era : most points , most wins , most goals scored , best goal differential , longest undefeated streak , most points clear of runners-up and most goals by a single player .Flamengo participated in the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time in the club's history in 2019 in Qatar. The club defeated Al Hilal SFC 3–1 in the semi-final, but lost 0–1 to Liverpool in the final. Flamengo's crest has changed slightly throughout the club's history. Most of the changes has been changes to the interlocked letters monogram, with the latest redesign being unveiled in 2018.The club uses three crests in different situations: the full crest is used as the club's official logo, the rowing crest is used for all rowing related uniforms and equipment, and the white \"CRF\" monogram is typically the only component of the crest worn on the primary football uniform. Beginning in 1980, Flamengo wore three white stars aligned vertically along the side of their monogram crest to indicate their three state league tri-championships . When Nike became Flamengo's kit provider in 2000, their first kit featured the full shield crest with three stars above it for the first time. In 2001 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the 1981 Copa Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup championships, a gold star was introduced above the crest. In 2005 the club returned to primarily using only the \"CRF\" monogram crest on their shirts. The single gold star continues to feature above the crest. At the 1895 meeting which established the Flamengo rowing club, the club's official colors were decided as blue and gold to symbolized the sky of Rio de Janeiro and the riches of Brazil. The team adopted a uniform of thick blue and gold horizontal stripes. However Flamengo failed to win a single regatta in their first year and gained the nickname of \"bronze club.\" The team colors were perceived as bad luck, and the colored fabric was expensive to import from England. One year after the club's establishment, the official colors were replaced with the current red and black. In 1912, at the request of the Flamengo rowing team , the football players dressed in shirts divided into red and black quarters which became known as the papagaio de vintém uniform, named after a particular style of kite. However the shirt became synonymous with bad luck and was replaced in 1913 by a shirt with red and black horizontal stripes and thinner white bands. This uniform was nicknamed the cobra coral due to its similarity to the pattern of a coral snake. This was the uniform worn when Flamengo won their first Campeonato Carioca title in 1914. The white bands were removed from the shirt in 1916 as the pattern was very similar to the flag of Germany at the time, who Brazil was allied against in World War I. The rowing team permitted the football team to use their same uniform, and Flamengo's traditional football uniform of a red and black striped shirt, white shorts and red-black socks was born.In 1938, Flamengo manager Dori Kruschner suggested the creation of a secondary white uniform to \"improve the visibility in night matches.\" The new uniform was approved by the club, and Flamengo became a pioneer of secondary uniforms in Brazil. The white shirt had two red and black stripes across the chest until 1979 when it was changed to a plain white chest with stripes on the sleeves. This was the shirt worn by the team that won the 1981 Intercontinental Cup. Beginning in the 1990s the club began to experiment with their second and third alternative uniforms, sometimes wearing all black or all red shirts. In 1995 for the club's centenary, a \"papagaio de vintém\" shirt was worn in friendlies. In 2010 uniform supplier Olympikus introduced a blue and gold alternative uniform which paid homage to Flamengo's original colors and regatta uniform, however it was not well-received by fans who likened it to the uniform worn by the fictional satirical team \"Tabajara\" on the popular comedy program Casseta & Planeta Urgente. In the first half of the 2009 season, the team wore a uniform without sponsorship for the first time in 25 years. Flamengo have continued to traditionally wear red and black striped shirts with white shorts as their primary uniform. The following is a list of Flamengo's sponsors and uniform suppliers. Flamengo's first official home ground was the Estádio da Rua Paysandu . The ground formerly belonged to Paissandu Atlético Clube before they ceased playing football in 1914. The owners of the ground rented the field to Flamengo where they played their home matches from 1915 to 1932. Between 1912 and 1915 , the club played all their matches on the grounds of Botafogo or Fluminense. The first Flamengo match at Rua Paysandu was played on October 31, 1915 in the Campeonato Carioca against Bangu. Crowds of 15,000 watched Flamengo face Fluminese at the park in 1918 and 1919. Flamengo's home stadium is nominally the Estádio da Gávea , which was inaugurated on September 4, 1938, and has a capacity of 4,000 people. The stadium is named after José Bastos Padilha, Flamengo's president at the time of the stadium's construction, from 1933 to 1937. Even though Flamengo no longer play their matches at Gávea, the site serves as the club's administrative headquarters. Since the 1990s, the stadium has been used almost exclusively for the club's youth and women's teams' matches, and as the training ground for the senior team. Most matches are played at the significantly larger Maracanã Stadium, considered by supporters as the real Flamengo home ground. Gávea Stadium is not actually located in the neighborhood of Gávea but rather in Leblon. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the Dutch National Team used the Estádio da Gávea and all of its facilities as their training ground in preparation for the competition. Since its construction for the 1950 World Cup, the Maracanã has primarily served as the home ground for the four biggest Rio de Janeiro clubs. The stadium was officially completed in 1965, 17 years after construction began. In 1963, more than 194,000 people attended a match between Flamengo and Fluminense at the Maracanã. The capacity of the stadium allowed Flamengo to have the largest support of any clubs in Brazil for much of the 20th century. In 1989 Zico scored his final goal in the historic stadium, setting the current unbroken record for goals in the Maracanã at 333. An upper stand in the stadium collapsed on July 19, 1992, in the second match of the finals of 1992 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A between Botafogo and Flamengo, leading to the death of three spectators and injuring 50 others. Following the disaster, the stadium's capacity was greatly reduced as it was converted to an all-seater stadium in the late 1990s. Following its 50th anniversary in 2000, the stadium underwent renovations which would increase its full capacity to around 103,000. After years of planning and nine months of closure between 2005 and 2006 , the stadium was reopened in January 2007 with an all-seated capacity of 87,000. For the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics and Paralympics, a major reconstruction project was initiated in 2010. The original seating bowl, with a two-tier configuration, was demolished, giving way to a new one-tier seating bowl.The stadium is officially under the management of Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht as of 2013. This has resulted in unfavorable rental agreements for Flamengo who do not officially administer the stadium and often owe rental fees for matches in excess of their ticket revenue, even for matches with high attendance. The most recent rental agreement was signed in 2018 and is valid through 2020. In April 2019, Flamengo and Fluminense came to an agreement with the state and the operators of the Maracanã to serve as joint-managers of the venue for the following six months, a deal which allowed the clubs to pay a fixed monthly fee and receive a higher share of matchday revenue than was granted under the previous deal. In 2017, Flamengo played their home matches at the Estádio Luso Brasileiro of Portuguesa while disputing their stadium situation with the Rio de Janeiro state government and Complexo Maracanã Entretenimento S.A. , the operator of the Maracanã Stadium. A three-year agreement was signed with Portuguesa over management of Estádio Luso Brasileiro, named Ilha do Urubu by Flamengo supporters in a poll. The park was renovated to fit 20,500 spectators. Flamengo started playing at the arena in March 2017, but after several delays and administrative issues and a new contract with the Maracanã, Flamengo broke their lease with the Ilha do Urubu in July 2018. The Clássico dos Milhões is the traditional Brazilian derby between Flamengo and Vasco da Gama, both from Rio de Janeiro. It is considered one of the biggest rivalries in Brazilian football and in football worldwide. The derby's name originated in the 1920s and refers to the two largest fanbases in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Both clubs were established in the late 19th century as regatta rowing clubs. The first football match between the clubs was played in 1923 when Vasco entered the top division of the Carioca state league. From the 1972 to 2001, the matchup was elevated as the most important of Flamengo's rivalries and became one of the biggest rivalries in all of Brazil. In this span, Flamengo and Vasco played in or won the final of each of the phases of the state championship nearly every year, frequently facing one another. This also coincided with the beginnings of the national Campeonato Brasileiro and the growth in popularity of both clubs nationwide. The most iconic matches between Flamengo and Vasco featured the idols of both clubs challenging each other: Zico of Flamengo and Roberto Dinamite of Vasco da Gama . The rivalry between these two clubs began in October 1911 when a group of dissatisfied players from Fluminense left their club and joined Flamengo, establishing the football department at their new club. The first Fla–Flu ever was played the following year on July 7. Fluminense won the match 3–2, with 800 people in attendance. Flamengo and Fluminense are the two most successful team in the Campeonato Carioca: as of 2019 Flamengo have 35 state league titles and Fluminense have 31. In 1963, the Maracanã held 194,603 spectators to watch the Fla-Flu match. The first confrontation between Rio de Janeiro rivals Flamengo and Botafogo occurred in 1913. The match became known as the Clássico da Rivaldade in the 1960s. Flamengo's mascot of the vulture originated during the June 1, 1969 match against Botafogo when Flamengo supporters released a vulture onto the field in response to the racist cheers of urubu from the Botafogo supporters. Flamengo's top scorer in the derby is Zico and Botafogo's top scorer is Heleno de Freitas. Flamengo has an inter-state rivalry with Atlético Mineiro of Minas Gerais, developed in the 1980s from numerous controversial encounters between the two clubs in that decade's Campeonato Brasileiro and Copa Libertadores editions. It maintained its high intensity through the following years, and is considered one of the biggest interstate rivalries in Brazilian football. Since the early 1990s, surveys have shown that Flamengo is consistently the most supported club in Brazil with an estimated more than 30 million fans. In a 2018 survey, 23% of football fans in Brazil consider themselves supporters of Flamengo, with high levels of support in the North and Northeast regions, in addition to Rio de Janeiro. Flamengo supporters are known as Nação Rubro-Negra . The first organized supporters group in all of Brazil, Charanga Rubro-Negra , was founded in support of Flamengo in 1942. Since then, a large number of additional organized supporters groups have formed around Flamengo, notably Torcida Jovem-Fla , Urubuzada , Flamanguaça , and Raça Rubro-Negra . In 2007 Flamengo supporters were declared as part of the cultural heritage of the city of Rio de Janeiro, along with bossa nova and Bola Preta, the oldest Carnival block in Rio.In the 1983 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A final, Flamengo played against Santos in the Maracanã in front of an official crowd of 155,523 with some estimates of over 160,000 people in attendance. The largest ever attendance for a Flamengo match was against Fluminense in 1963 with 194,603 spectators. Flamengo matches in the Maracanã have broken the 150,000 attendance mark thirteen times.

In 2002 the women's Carioca tournament was not organized, and the club ceased operation of the team. Flamengo attempted to re-established their women's professional football department in 2011 through a partnership with the city of Guarujá where the team trained and hoped to sign Marta, but the team never materialized. In 2015 president Eduardo Bandeira de Mello succeeded in establishing the football team through a partnership with the Brazilian Navy. In their first season, the team won the women's Campeonato Carioca state championship and have won it every season from 2015 to 2019. In 2016 Flamengo won the Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Feminino for the first time against Rio Preto, become the only club outside the state of São Paulo to win the tournament since its creation in 2013. Flamengo also competed in the 2016 and 2017 Copa do Brasil de Futebol Feminino before the cancellation of the competition in favor of the Campeonato Brasileiro. Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Feminino: 12016Campeonato Carioca de Futebol Feminino: 52015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 The Flamengo women's basketball team won back-to-back Brazilian championships in 1954 and 1955. Ten years later with some of the same players, the program won back-to-back Brazilian titles again in 1964 and 1965. Flamengo players Norminha, Angelina, Marlene and Delei were champions of the 1967 Pan American Games in Winnipeg with the Brazil women's national basketball team. In 1966 Flamengo won the Inter-club Basketball World Championship. The team was led by Angelina, considered one of the best players of her time. The \"Flamengo Regatta Group\", later renamed the \"Flamengo Regatta Club\", was established in 1895 as Flamengo's first ever organized athletic department, forming the basis of the club's history and identity to this day. The first regatta victory came in 1898 in the Nautical Championship of Brazil, and the first title was won in 1900, the Regatta of the IV Centenary of the Discovery of Brazil, for which the club was awarded the Jug Tropon trophy. In 1905 the club won a classic event, the South American Cup. By 1908, Flamengo had already won 43 gold, 126 silver and 141 bronze medals. The success of the rowing club made the team famous even before the founding of the football department in 1911. Great rowers such as Everardo Paes de Lima, Arnaldo Voigt, Alfredo Correia , Ângelo Gammaro and Antônio Rebello Junior came through Flamengo, the latter three being considered Brazilian sports heroes for completing the Rio-Santos crossing in 1932. From 1931 to 1937 Flamengo were seven-time champions of Rio de Janeiro, and were four-time repeat state champions from 1940 to 1943. In 1963 the \"Buck era\" began, which revolutionized Flamengo rowing. The coach brought in athletes from other states and renovated the club's facilities to better accommodate the boats. Buck was coach of the Brazilian National Team, directing the team in several international competitions. In the early 1980s, Flamengo won the state championship and won again in 1992. The club has won the men's Brazil Trophy 10 times, and the female once, in addition to 45 Carioca state titles. Water polo is the second oldest sport practiced by the club, after rowing. The team played their first game on May 27, 1913 in Rio de Janeiro, and defeated Clube Internacional de Regatas, 3–2. Flamengo only opened its water sports facility in 1965. Prior to that, athletes played and trained in the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon or in the sea. Flamengo's first polo championship in Rio de Janeiro came in 1985 and was the start of a run of nine consecutive championships through 1993. In 1985 the club won the South American Club Championship and the Brazil Trophy . A female water polo team was established in 1987, winning the Brazil Trophy in 1987 and 1991 and the state championship in 1995. The club launched their American football team in 2013, forming a partnership with the Rio de Janeiro Emperors. The Emperors were established in 2008 and had previously partnered with Fluminense from 2010 to 2013. The team officially goes by the name of the Flamengo Emperors and compete in the BFA . Flamengo began playing tennis championships in 1916 and became three-time Rio champions soon after , even with their athletes training at other clubs. Until 1932 the club practiced tennis on their football field at the Rua Paysandu. In 1963 the club inaugurated their own facilities and courts. The biggest idol of Flamengo's tennis department is Thomas Koch. In 2017 the club announced they would be entering the increasingly popular e-sports leagues the following year, beginning with a League of Legends department and eventually establishing a PES team. Because the competitive League of Legends center of Brazil is at the Riot Games studio in São Paulo, Flamengo established a permanent \"gaming office\" for the team in the city. Flamengo announced that they would not be partnering with an existing team but rather would have their own team. In October 2017 they announced the purchase of Merciless Gaming, a team in the 2nd division of the Brazilian League of Legends championship.
